Name :  237. Delete Node in a Linked List

There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.
You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to 
the first node of head.
All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the
given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean
removing it from memory. We mean:

The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
All the values before node should be in the same order.
All the values after node should be in the same order.


SOLUTION:
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        node->val = node->next->val;
        node->next = node->next->next;
    }
};

Summary:

This solution deletes a node from a singly linked list when
only that node is given (not the head).
It copies the value of the next node into the current node.
Then it skips the next node by updating the next pointer.
Effectively, the given node takes the place of its next node,
and the next node is removed from the list.

Key points:

Works only if node is not the last node.
Time complexity: O(1)
No extra memory used.
This is a common LeetCode trick for deleting a node without
access to the head.
